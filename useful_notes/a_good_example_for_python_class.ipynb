It is worth mentioning at this point that classes are usually saved in a separate file, and then imported into the program you are working on. So you can build a library of classes, and use those classes over and over again in different programs.

Then it would check if that rocket is too close, and print a warning message if the rocket is too close. If there is zero distance between the two rockets, your method could print a message such as, \"The rockets have crashed!\" (Be careful; getting a zero distance could mean that you accidentally found the distance between a rocket and itself, rather than a second rocket.)"

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of stable, reliable, reusable code. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can inherit from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class inherits all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the parent class, and the new class is a child of the parent class. The parent class is also called a superclass, and the child class is also called a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class inherits all attributes and behavior from the parent class, but any attributes that are defined in the child class are not available to the parent class. This may be obvious to many people, but it is worth stating. This also means a child class can override behavior of the parent class. If a child class defines a method that also appears in the parent class, objects of the child class will use the new method rather than the parent class method.\n",
